### settings-section.js drag-drop handler — mutation before rerender

**Reviewer suggestion:** Remove the `pendingPreferredIds.filter(...)` mutation at lines 461-463 because "the deactivation toast logic starting at line 466 already handles building the correct method list and the `rerender()` call will reflect the updated state."

**Reason ignored:** The suggestion is based on a misreading of the code. The `allMethods` list built at line 466 is used only to look up the display name for the toast; it does not update `pendingPreferredIds`. Removing the filter mutation would mean `pendingPreferredIds` still contains the deactivated method after the drag, causing `rerender()` to show an incorrect UI state where the method appears as preferred even though it was dragged to the available table.
