# Messages browser client

The Messages browser client lets modules list room messages, open private rooms, and send messages through the Social Messages adapter's authenticated API contract.

## Usage examples

Import `uiCtx`, require `social:messagesUiClient`, and call `listRoomMessages(roomId, options)`, `openPrivateRoom(payload, options)`, or `sendRoomMessage(roomId, payload)` from browser code.

## Technical specification

The client returns the original `Response` for caller-owned status and payload handling. It URI-encodes room IDs, keeps route knowledge inside the owning adapter, forwards optional access tokens and access-denied suppression, sends JSON for writes, and is available only while the Social gateway and Messages adapter are enabled.
