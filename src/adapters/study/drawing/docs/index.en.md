# Drawing Practice

## Purpose

The Drawing adapter contributes `study:drawing:open` to browser `uiCtx`. Callers pass a complete Library card and its validated `strokePattern`; the adapter opens a movable, resizable PiP writing pad.

## Practice model

The pad accepts pen, touch, and mouse input, enforces provider stroke order, scores direction and path proximity, tracks completed strokes, supports undo/reset, and provides four guidance levels from blank recall to the full pattern.
